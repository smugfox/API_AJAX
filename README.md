# API_AJAX

Finished tutorial from LearnCode.academy on jQuery and using it with AJAX and an API.  I learned how to make POST, PUT, DELETE requests to an API, as well as use mustache for templating code, and also how to make buttons appear when in edit mode, and when not in edit mode.

Doesn't work becuase Yeoman for some reason doesn't add the mustache.js file into my index file when I typed grunt build =/
